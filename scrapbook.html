In Greek mythology, Prometheus is a Titan god of fire and supreme trickster. 
<br> He is credited with the creation of humanity from clay, and of defying the gods by stealing fire and giving it to mankind. 
<br>For this transgression, Zeus sentenced him to eternal torment. Prometheus was bound to a rock, and an eagle devoured his liver in an ongoing cycle finally ended when he was freed by Heracles.

 <span style="color: brown;" > Origins </span> <br>
Prometheus first appears in the epic Theogony, by eight century BC poet Hesiod, where he tricks Zeus into accepting the bones and fat of a sacrifice instead of the meat. Zeus hides fire from mortals in retaliation and Prometheus steals it back, only to be nailed to a mountain in the Caucasus. Zeus also creates the first woman, Pandora, who takes the lid off her jar and unleashes havoc. In Works and Days, Hesiod expands the story, having Zeus deny man not only fire, but the means of life itself. 
<br>Another likely source of the myth is the Titanomachy, a lost epic from the same century about the struggle between the Greek gods and their parents, the Titans. <br> 
Prometheus Bound, by fifth century BC tragedian Aeschylus, was also hugely influential, making Prometheus man’s preserver, and having him bestow upon them the arts and sciences. Many Greek and Roman authors – Sappho, Ovid – embellished the myth subsequently, allotting Prometheus a key role in the creation of the human race.
